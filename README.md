# Portable-Optical-Monitoring-of-Microplastics-5-mm-in-Water-Bodies
A portable, low‑cost optical system for monitoring microplastics (&lt;5 mm) in water bodies. The project combines density separation, filtration, and optical imaging with software‑based analysis to detect and quantify microplastics on‑site, enabling scalable and field‑deployable environmental monitoring.
